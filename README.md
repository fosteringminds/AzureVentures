# Welcome to AzureVentures

My adventures using Azure, or starting a new venture using Azure. You make up your mind.

The purpose of AzureVentures is to keep a repository of the things I work on whilst learning as as possible about Azure. The goal is to write things like articles or documents but also to write code to achieve specific things.
